    <h3 style="color:chocolate"> * 3.  Check and fix missing images and broken links on the live site before user testing  </h3>
  
    <p>
        Mainly fixed the React page as a vulnerable dependency detected by GitHub and they suggested to  upgrade querystringify >= 2.0.0 defined in package-lock.json.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Also updated some styles links and etc. and updated the React App in GitHub Pages
